# EADSED
Cooperative Dual-Branch Framework with Language-Queried Separation for Noise-Robust Sound Event Detection
This repository contains a cooperative framework for noise-robust sound event detection. We provide experimental results under various SNR conditions ranging from -5dB to 10dB. The repository includes PSDS1 and PSDS2 scores, experimental implementations, and logs from corresponding folders.
